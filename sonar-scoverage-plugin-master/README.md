Plugin for [SonarQube] that imports statement coverage generated by [Scoverage] for Scala projects.

Scoverage measures how many statements of a given Scala program have been covered by automated tests. This
new metric is much better for Scala than traditional line coverage and branch coverage because typically:

 1. There are many statements on a single line
 2. `if` statements are used rarely

This plugin reads XML report generated by Scoverage and populates several metrics in Sonar:

 1. Total number of statements
 2. Number of statements covered by tests
 3. Statement coverage rate (%)

Projects with sub-projects are supported as well. Overall statement coverage is (sum of number of covered statements
for all sub-projects) / (total number of statements for all sub-projects). In other words, it's more intelligent than
just plain average of coverage rates for sub-projects.

## Requirements ##

- [SonarQube] 5.1
- [Scoverage] 1.1.0

### Support for older versions of Sonar ###

- [SonarQube 4.5] (https://github.com/RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin/tree/sonar45)
- [SonarQube 4.2] (https://github.com/RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin/tree/sonar42)
- [SonarQube 3.5] (https://github.com/RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin/tree/sonar35)

## Installation ##

Download and copy [the plugin jar](https://github.com/RadoBuransky/sonar-scoverage-plugin/releases) to the Sonar plugins directory
(usually <SONAR_INSTALLATION_ROOT>/extensions/plugins). Restart Sonar.

## Configure Sonar runner ##

Set location of the **scoverage.xml** file in the **sonar-project.properties** located in your project's
root directory:

    ...
    sonar.scoverage.reportPath=target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/scoverage.xml
    ...

## Run Scoverage and Sonar runner ##

If your project is based on SBT and you're using [Scoverage plugin for SBT] [sbt-scoverage] you can
generate the Scoverage report by executing following from command line:

    $ sbt clean coverage test

And then run Sonar runner to upload the report to the Sonar server:

    $ sonar-runner

## Add statement coverage columns ##

To see the actual statement coverage percentage you need to log in to Sonar as admin.
Click **Components** section on the left side, then click **Customize ON** in the top-right corner and then
add **Statement coverage** column.

## Add widget ##

You can also add **Statement coverage widget** to your project's dashboard. Log in to Sonar as admin. Go to
the project dashboard, click **Configure widgets** in the top-right corner, click **Add widget** button in
the **Custom Measures** section. Click **Edit** in the newly added **Custom Measures** widget and choose
**Statement coverage** for **Metric 1**. Click **Save**, **Back to dashboard**. Enjoy.

## Sample project ##

Take a look at a sample SBT multi-module project located in this repository in the `samples` folder.
